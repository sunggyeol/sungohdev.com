I am a recent graduate from Virginia Tech who majored in Computer Science with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction, graduated summa cum laude with a 3.9 GPA. I was an undergraduate research assistant at the Notification Systems Lab (Tech on the Trail) and IDEEAS Lab, focusing on applying LLMs and NLP to education through human-centered approaches. My work has been published at premier venues including ACM CHI, ACM CSCW, and IEEE FIE. I have also worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Fasoo, where I worked on a speech-to-speech pipeline optimizing latency with VAD, and as a Research Assistant at Abear, where I researched content generation pipelines with image models for B2B applications. I am now working at Kearney as a Research Analyst.
