title: "DiaryQuest"
description: "My team and I built DiaryQuest, a web-based platform that streamlines HCI-focused diary studies with intuitive submission tools, progress tracking, and sentiment analysis. To enhance feedback quality, we fine-tuned the Mistral 7B model to generate constructive, rubric-based feedback and thematic insights from student reflections. This integration enables scalable, AI-assisted evaluation and promotes deeper engagement in large classroom settings."
