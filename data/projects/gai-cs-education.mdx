title: "Explore Public's Perspectives on Generative AI in Computer Science (CS) Education: A Social Media Data Analysis"
description: "This project involved analyzing public sentiment towards Generative AI in CS education using both BERT-based models and Large Language Models (LLMs). I collected and filtered Reddit comments to identify key concerns and benefits of Generative AI tools in educational settings. The findings reveal a general positive sentiment towards the use of AI for learning but also highlight challenges such as academic dishonesty and over-reliance on AI."
